          <dd>Minigit is a minimal Ruby interface for Git. It is a simple proxy that runs Git commands, and optionally captures output. It does not provide any abstraction provided by Grit or Git gems. It is just a simple wrapper over system('git ...') call. It also allows capturing output of Git commands.</dd>

          <dd>TinyConfig provides a base class to create a Ruby configuration file loader. The resulting configuration file is usable for people not familiar with Ruby, but it is possible for a power user to use full power of Ruby to script the configuration.</dd>

          <dd>Vendor everything. Keep your own copies of upstream dependencies that your project needs somewhere close to your project, best in the same source control repository. But how to do it, and keep track of all the upstream modules, their origin and license, upgrades, local changes, and so on? It's what Vendorificator helps you with.</dd>
